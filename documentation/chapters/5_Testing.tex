\chapter{Testing}
Testing is a substantial part of the MangaVerse web application project. Testing helps to ensure application's 
reliability, performance and correctness. To be able to conduct efficient testing process, two kind of tests are preformed.
They are JUnit testing as a structural testing and functional testing.

\section{Structural Testing}
Structural testing also with other name white-box testing is based on testing the internal structure of the working application and it 
guarantees that the methods are working as expected.JUnit testing framework is used to conduct structural testing. JUnit testing is performed by testing 
different modules of the application such as DAOs and services. With that process each methods efficiency and correctness is guaranteed. 
Some examples of JUnit testing are shown below.\\ \\


\textbf{Example code snippet from AnimeDAOMongoImplTest:}

\begin{mdframed}[style=customstyle]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
class AnimeDAOMongoImplTest {

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() throws Exception {

    public void tearDown() throws Exception {
        BaseMongoDBDAO.closeConnection();
    }
    // test 1 : search for an anime by name
    // test 2 : search for an anime by filters
    @Test
    void searchTest() {
        AnimeDAOMongoImpl animeDAO = new AnimeDAOMongoImpl();

        // test 1
        System.out.println("Search by title");
        assertDoesNotThrow(() -> {
            List<MediaContentDTO> animeList = animeDAO.search(List.of(Pair.of("title", "Attack on Titan")), Map.of("title", 1), 1, false).getEntries();
            for (MediaContentDTO anime : animeList) {
                System.out.println("Id: " + anime.getId() + ", Title: " + anime.getTitle());
            }

\section{Functional Testing}
Functional testing also with other name black-box testing is based on testing the application's external functionalities. It checks the application from end-user's 
perspective. It ensures that specified requirements are provided efficiently by the web application and expected is outcome is created. 
With the help of the use cases and real world scenarios, functional testing is conducted. Some examples of functional testing are shown below.

\section{Performance Testing}

Performance testing is conducted to ensure that MangaVerse web application is able to handle the 
a high volume of operations efficiently and provides a smooth experience for users. 
It is important to test the application's performance to ensure that it 
can handle the expected load. Performance testing is applied on MongoDB and Neo4j databases.
Specifically, the aim of the performance testing is to see the impacts of indexing on CRUD operations
and aggregation operations. 

\vspace{\baselineskip}

\subsection*{MongoDB Performance Testing}
Indexes are used in MongoDB to improve the performance of queries. Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every document in a collection.
This limiting the search with indexes, results can get with faster response time.
For the mongoDB performance testing, \textit{username} is used to indexing Users collection and \textit{title} is
used to indexing Anime and Manga collections. The tests are conducted for creating new documents and searching for documents.
As it can be shown in the table below, there are significant improvement in operation times with indexing, especially for search tasks

\begin{longtable}{@{}cccccc@{}}
\caption{MongoDB Performance Test Results} \\
\toprule
\textbf{Collection} & \textbf{Operation} & \textbf{Index} & \textbf{Time (ms)} & \textbf{Total Keys Examined} & \textbf{Total Docs Examined} \\ \midrule

\bottomrule
\endlastfoot

\multirow{6}{*}{Users}
 & Insert & No & 3 & - & - \\
 & Search & No & 17 & 0 & 10007 \\
 & Insert & Yes & 5 & - & - \\
 & Search & Yes & 5 & 1 & 1 \\ \midrule

\multirow{6}{*}{Anime}
 & Insert & No & 3 & - & - \\
 & Search & No & 88 & 0 & 30113 \\
 & Insert & Yes & 3 & - & - \\
 & Search & Yes & 10 & 0 & 1 \\\midrule

\multirow{6}{*}{Manga}
 & Insert & No & 3 & - & - \\
 & Search & No & 141 & 0 & 41677 \\
 & Insert & Yes & 3 & - & - \\
 & Search & Yes & 10 & 1 & 1 \\

\end{longtable}

\newpage

\subsection*{Neo4j Performance Testing}

Similarly, also for Neo4j database, performance testing is conducted to observe the impacts of indexing on some CRUD operations.
Indexing with ids is used for both anime, manga and users nodes. The tests are conducted for creating new nodes and searching for nodes.
The test result in the table below shows that indexing has a significant impact on operations in Neo4j database especially for search.
Indexing time decreases with using indexes for search tasks because it prevents to check all the nodes in the database.
