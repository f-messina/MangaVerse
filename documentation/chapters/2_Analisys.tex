anime-planet.com,		nofity.moe,	   anisearch.com,		  anidb.net 	

\textit{Description:} Manga, users and scores datasets were collected from MyAnimeList.net site using the official API and another unofficial API (Jikan). The anime datasets were collected from all the sources. 

\textit{Variety:} The datasets contain a variety of data types, including text, numbers, and dates. Anime are collected from 8 different sources. All the information is collected in 4 different csv files.

\textit{Volume:} The datasets contain a large volume of data, with thousands of entries for anime, manga, users, and scores. The total size of the datasets is around 3 GB.

\subsection{Data Cleaning and Preprocessing}
Python scripts were used to clean and preprocess the data. The following steps were performed:
reviews were created by merging the users and scores datasets, and creating comments about the media contents;
the anime dataset was created by putting togethere the diffrerent sources;
the manga dataset was created from MyAnimeList.net;
the users dataset was cleaned and missing information, like email and password, was added.
